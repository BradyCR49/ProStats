# ProStats

SwiftUI App that is using the FireBase API to use existing data for college football statistical analysis. 
This app will be developed for the IOS platform using SwiftUI and Firebase on the backend. What 
will make project different from existing apps are the UX elements and the dedication to being 
focused on stats more than live scores. Most sports apps just have stats as a secondary to live 
score keeping. With the app that I plan on developing, users will be able to receive an in-depth 
breakdown of certain team stats that will no longer just be numbers on a screen but a visual 
representation to easily bring those numbers to life.
